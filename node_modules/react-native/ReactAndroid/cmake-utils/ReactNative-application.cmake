# This CMake file takes care of creating everything you need to build and link
# your C++ source code in a React Native Application for Android.
# You just need to call `project(<my_project_name>)` and import this file.
# Specifically this file will:
# - Take care of creating a shared library called as your project
# - Take care of setting the correct compile options
# - Include all the pre-built libraries in your build graph
# - Link your library against those prebuilt libraries so you can access JSI, Fabric, etc.
# - Link your library against any autolinked library.
